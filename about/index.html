    <h1>About the Hall of wWAR</h1>
    <p>I love the Hall of Fame. But the Hall of Fame sucks.</p>
    <p>Every year a player (or several) like Bert Blyleven, Tim Raines, or Edgar Martinez will hit the ballot. An alarming number of baseball writers and fans will argue that these players aren&rsquo;t deserving of the Hall of Fame. They will forget&mdash;or perhaps not even know&mdash;that the Hall of Fame already features players like Rube Marquard, Chick Hafey, or Tommy Freakin&rsquo; McCarthy. Inducting a Bert Blyleven or an Edgar Martinez would never, ever hurt the &ldquo;purity&rdquo; of the Hall of Fame. That was soiled long ago.</p>
    <p>This made me question what actually makes a player Hall of Fame-worthy. Take a guy like Will Clark. He&rsquo;s certainly no Lou Gehrig or Jimmie Foxx. But he&rsquo;s a hell of a lot better than High Pockets Kelly or Jim Bottomley (both first basemen were inducted to the Hall of Fame). To determine whether or not Clark should be a Hall of Famer, I now have to do this balancing act between how much worse he is than the elite players at his position and how much better he is that some guys already inducted.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s an absolute mess. The only way to fix it is to kick everyone out of the Hall of Fame and start from scratch. So that&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Why even bother voting for the Hall of Fame?&rdquo; they ask us stat geeks. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just pick a WAR cutoff and everyone above the line is a Hall of Famer?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Hey, that&rsquo;s not a bad idea. I love WAR (Wins Above Replacement). If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with WAR, <a href="http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2011/2/28/2019517/using-trammell-and-reuschel-to-explain-war">I wrote about it in detail</a>. To me, it is the best way to use a single number to gauge a player&rsquo;s Hall of Fame case. However, I don&rsquo;t want to re-populate the Hall of Fame using &ldquo;plain old&rdquo; WAR. We all know there&rsquo;s more to a Hall of Fame case than simply providing value (and one of the knocks on WAR is that it rewards &ldquo;compilers&rdquo;). Things like peak performance and postseason heroics can enhance to a player&rsquo;s case. Those happen to be two of the adjustments that go into my weighted version of WAR. I call it wWAR.</p>
    <p>Time to geek out. Here&rsquo;s the formula:</p>
    <h2><abbr title="Weighted Wins Above Replacement">wWAR</abbr> = <abbr title="Wins Above Replacement per 162 Games">WAR/162</abbr> + <abbr title="Wins Above Excellence">WAE</abbr> + <abbr title="Wins Above MVP">WAM</abbr> + <abbr title="Weighted Postseason Win Probability Added">wWPA</abbr></h2>
    <p>What do all those acronyms mean?</p>
    <h3><abbr title="Wins Above Replacement per 162 Games">WAR/162</abbr></h3>
    <p>In 1872, Ross Barnes posted 5.2 WAR. In 2011, Prince Fielder also posted 5.2 WAR. But which was more impressive? Fielder produced his 5.2 wins in a 162 game schedule. Barnes did the same in a 48-game schedule. WAR/162 projects Barnes&rsquo; WAR to a 162-game schedule, making him worth 17.6 WAR/162. Holy crap, huh?</p>
    <p>I typically just used the league schedule for all seasons. But in more volatile leagues (like the National Association, Union Association, etc.) I went team-by-team (since there were several cases of teams folding mid-season). For pitching seasons in 1891 and older, I don&rsquo;t project the pitching numbers. This is because of the huge differences in pitcher usage then. I do, however, project the pitchers&rsquo; hitting stats from those years.</p>
    <p>I originally wrote about WAR/162 on Beyond the Box Score (for <a href="http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2011/9/7/2406964/hurt-by-their-era-the-effect-of-shorter-seasons-on-career-value">hitters</a> and <a href="http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2011/9/19/2426965/hurt-by-their-era-19th-century-pitchers-war-162-and-wwar">pitchers</a>).</p>
    <h3><abbr title="Wins Above Excellence">WAE</abbr></h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/blog_article/andre-dawson-and-two-contemporaries/">Wins Above Excellence</a>, originally devised by Sean Smith (the father of Baseball-Reference&rsquo;s WAR), is the total of all single season WAR above 3.0. WAE aims to measure only &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; seasons (while its cousin Wins Above MVP aims to capture dominant MVP-worthy performances).</p>
    <p>There are some exceptions to the 3.0 baseline:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For catchers, the WAE baseline is 2.0.</li>
      <li>For relief pitchers (20% or more of appearances in relief), the WAE baseline is 1.5.</li>
      <li>For starting pitchers with 400-500 innings, the WAE baseline is 4.5.</li>
      <li>For starting pitchers with 500-600 innings, the WAE baseline is 6.0.</li>
      <li>For starting pitchers with 600-700 innings, the WAE baseline is 7.5.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Wins Above Excellence disregards negative position player WAR or pitcher WAR that drags a player&rsquo;s total WAR down. For example, if a pitcher posts 4.0 pitching WAR and -0.3 WAR as a hitter, his WAE will be 1.0. He is not docked for the negative WAR at the plate because he is already docked for it in his overall WAR.</p>
    <h3><abbr title="Wins Above MVP">WAM</abbr></h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2010/2/25/1325611/wins-above-mvp-level">Wins Above MVP</a> is the total of all single season WAR above 6.0. After Sean Smith came up with WAE, I whipped up WAM as a way to capture dominant MVP-worthy performances.</p>
    <p>There are some exceptions to the 6.0 baseline:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For catchers, the WAM baseline is 4.0.</li>
      <li>For relief pitchers (20% or more of appearances in relief), the WAM baseline is 3.0.</li>
      <li>For starting pitchers with 400-500 innings, the WAM baseline is 9.0.</li>
      <li>For starting pitchers with 500-600 innings, the WAM baseline is 12.0.</li>
      <li>For starting pitchers with 600-700 innings, the WAM baseline is 15.0.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Like WAE, Wins Above MVP disregards negative position player WAR or pitcher WAR.</p>
    <h3><abbr title="Weighted Postseason Win Probability Added">wWPA</abbr></h3>
    <p>Sure, postseason statistics break the &ldquo;small sample size&rdquo; rule. But postseason heroics absolutely add to a player&rsquo;s Hall of Fame case (while being a postseason goat hurts some). Since there is no postseason WAR, how do we capture that? We can use Win Probability Added (WPA), which measures a player&rsquo;s contribution to his team&rsquo;s victory. Add up his WPA and you have an estimate of the number of wins he was directly responsible for.</p>
    <p>I recently introduced a modification of postseason WPA called (of course) <a href="http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2011/10/17/2495296/wwpa-weighted-postseason-win-probability-added">wWPA (Weighted postseason Win Probability Added)</a>. The theory behind wWPA is that not all postseason series are created equal. I count the LDS once. I double count the LCS. And the World Series? It counts three times.</p>
    <p>In order to avoid double-counting negative values, I calculate it like: <strong>wWPA = Total Postseason WPA + LCSWPA + (2*WSWPA)</strong></p>
    <p>There you have it&mdash;those four statistics make up wWAR.</p>
    <p>Here are some other things I should mention about this project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All WAR data comes from <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/">Baseball-Reference</a>. This is the version of WAR created by Sean Smith (aka RallyMonkey) and originally posted on <a href="http://www.baseballprojection.com/">BaseballProjection.com</a>.</li>
      <li>In order to better show what the value cutoff should be, I keep the Hall of wWAR the same size as the Hall of Fame (206 inducted as players).</li>
      <li>I ignore performance enhancing drugs because we just don&rsquo;t know how to handle them yet. Besides, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5314753">they apparently go back to the 19th century</a>.</li>
      <li>I ignore lifetime bans. This opens up the Hall of wWAR to Pete Rose, Shoeless Joe, and any other banned players.</li>
      <li>I open this up for Hall of Famers who were inducted for a role other than player. This is why Hall of Famers Al Spalding (inducted as a pioneer) and John McGraw (inducted as a manager) aren&rsquo;t considered Hall of Famers in this exercise. Both <em>should</em> have been in because of their playing careers.</li>
      <li>While there is a basic wWAR cutoff for induction, I use different baselines for 1800s starting pitchers (they are so complicated), catchers (they have shorter careers), and relief pitchers (they just don&rsquo;t get as many opportunities to perform). I use normalized wWAR (wWAR/norm) to put all these baselines on a single scale, allowing me to sort all players by how good their Hall of Fame case is (this is how Rich Gossage can rank higher in wWAR/norm than he does by just plain wWAR).</li>
      <li>I can&rsquo;t include Negro League players. This project relies on WAR and there is no WAR for Negro League players. Trust me, I wish there was. One day I hope to add Negro League players to this project.</li>
      <li>I don&rsquo;t adjust for time lost to military service. I&rsquo;m just not comfortable doing that. I don&rsquo;t feel great about this because I know that Enos Slaughter (and perhaps others) would be inducted if I tried to estimate lost value.</li>
      <li>Pitching WAR does not exist for the National Association (1871&ndash;1875). Rather than ignore these players, <a href="http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2011/10/7/2473378/for-the-first-time-national-association-pitching-war-leaders">I estimated the WAR values</a>.</li>
    </ul>
